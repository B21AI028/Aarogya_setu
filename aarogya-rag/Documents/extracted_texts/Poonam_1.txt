Ferritin, Serum

SampleType: Serum Department of Clinical Biochemistry

INVESTIGATION RESULT UNITS BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE INTERVAL
Ferritin 8.5 ng/mL 10-291
Method: CLIA

Clinical Significance: Ferritin
¢ Ferritin is a compound composed of iron molecules bound to apoferritin. Stored iron represents about 25% of total iron in the
body, and most of this iron is stored as ferritin.

* Ferritin is found in serum in low concentrations and is directly proportional to the body’s iron stores.

* Serum ferritin concentration, when analyzed with serum iron, iron-binding capacity, and tissue iron stores, is valuable in the diagnosis of

iron-deficiency anemias, anemias of chronic infection, and conditions such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis.
* Measurement of serum ferritin is particularly valuable in distinguishing iron-deficiency anemias caused by low iron stores from those
resulting from inadequate iron utilization.

ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION
RATE (OR, eGFR)

What is eGFR test?

Glomeruli are tiny filters in your kidneys
that help remove toxins (waste) from
your blood. Estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) measures how
much blood these filters clean every
minute based on your body size.

What does eGFR tell healthcare
providers?

Your kidneys are part of the urinary
system. Kidney disease occurs when
one or both kidneys have damage.
When you have kidney disease,
dangerous toxins can build up in your
blood.

Kidney disease symptoms, such as
frequent urination and muscle spasms,
may not occur until you lose up to 40%
of kidney function. eGFR helps detect
the disease early so that you can start
treatments to slow or stop kidney
damage.
