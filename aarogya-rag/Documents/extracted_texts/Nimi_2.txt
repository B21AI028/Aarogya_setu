The calculated risk by PRISCA depends on the accuracy of the information provided by the referring Physician.

* This is a screening test,not a diagnostic test.This risk assessment report is based in part on demographic data provided by
the ordering Physician.Please notify the laboratory promptly if any data is incorrect.

*It is Statistical risk factor calculation for Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome), Trisomy 18 (Edward Syndrome) and Trisomy 13 using
CE marked PRISCA 5.1 software.

*Screening tests are based on statistical analysis of patient demographic and biochemical data. They simply indicate a high or
low risk category. The interpretive unit is MoM (Multiples of Median) which takes into account variables such as gestational age
(ultrasound), maternal weight, race, insulin dependent Diabetes, multiple gestation, IVF (Date of Birth of Donor, if applicable),
smoking & previous history of Down syndrome. Accurate availability of this data for Risk Calculation is critical. -

*Ideally all pregnant women should be screened for Prenatal disorders irrespective of maternal age. The test is valid between 9-
13.6 weeks of gestation, but ideal sampling time is between 11-13 weeks gestation.

* First trimester detection rate of Down syndrome is 60% with a false positive rate of 5%. A combination of Nuchal translucency,
Nasal bone visualization and biochemical tests (Combined test) increases the detection rate of Down syndrome to 85% at the
same false positive rate.

*Statistical evaluation enclosed being more informative ,the reference ranges for the biochemical parameters are not quoted on
the report.

*In case of CRL below 38mm,CRL & NT are not taken for calculation .

*Screening cutoffs are established by using MoM values that maximize the detection rate and minimize false positives.

* CLIA : Chemiluminescence Immunoassy.

Trisomy 21

The calculated risk for Trisomy 21 (with nuchal

translucency) is below the cut off, which indicates a

low risk.

After the result of the Trisomy 21 test (with NT) it is

expected that among more than 10000 women with the

same data, there is one woman with a trisomy 21

pregnancy.

The calculated risk by PRISCA depends on the accuracy

of the information provided by the referring physician.

Please note that risk calculations are statistical

approaches and have no diagnostic value!

The patient combined risk presumes the NT
