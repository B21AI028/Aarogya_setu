Comment:
Interpretation: HbA1c%

5.7-6.4 At Risk For Diabetes

Adapted from American Diabetes Association.

Comments:

A 3 to 6 monthly monitoring is recommended in diabetics. People with diabetes should get the test done more often if their blood
sugar stays too high or if their healthcare provider makes any change in the treatment plan. HbAic concentration represent the
integrated values for blood glucose over the preceding 8-12 weeks and is not affected by daily glucose fluctuation, exercise &
recent food intake.

Please note, Glycemic goal should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions,
known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.

Factors that interfere with HbAic Measurement: Hemoglobin variants, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and chemically modified
derivatives of hemoglobin (e.g. carbamylated Hb in patients with renal failure) can affect the accuracy of HbAic measurements.

Factors that affect interpretation of HbAic Measurement: Any condition that shortens erythrocyte survival or decrease mean
erythrocyte age (e. g., recovery from acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC) will falsely lower HbAic test
results regardless of the assay method used. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with higher HbAic.

Note: Presence of Hemoglobin variants and/or conditions that affect red cell turnover must be considered, particularly when the
HbAic result does not correlate with the patient's blood glucose levels.

Comment:

® As per the recommendation of International council for Standardization in Hematology, the differential leucocyte counts
are additionally being reported as absolute numbers of each cell in per unit volume of blood.

Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate 9 mnvhr <=19 Modified Westergren

Comment:

@ ESR provides an index of progress of the disease and is widely used as an indicator of inflammation, infection, trauma, or
malignant diseases. Changes are more significant than a single abnormal test
® It is specifically indicated to monitor the course or response to the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis,

tuberculosis bacterial endocarditis ,acute rheumatic fever ,Hodgkins disease,temporal arthritis , and systemic lupus
erythematosis; and to diagnose and monitor giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica.

® An elevated ESR may also be associated with many other conditions, including autoimmune disease, anemia,
infection,malignancy,pregnancy, multiple myeloma, menstruation, and hypothyroidism.

® Although a normal ESR cannot be taken to exclude the presence of organic disease, its rate is dependent on various
physiologic and pathologic factors.

® The most important component influencing ESR is the composition of plasma. High level of C-Reactive Protein, fibrinogen,

haptoglobin, alpha-1antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and immunoglobulins causes the elevation of Erythrocyte Sedimentation
Rate.

® Drugs that may cause increase ESR levels include: dextran, methyldopa, oral contraceptives, penicillamine, procainamide,
theophylline, and Vitamin A. Drugs that may cause decrease levels include: aspirin, cortisone, and quinine

Comment:

Iron is an essential trace mineral element which forms an important component of hemoglobin, metallocompounds and Vitamin
A. Deficiency of iron is seen in iron deficiency and anaemia of chronic disorders.

Increased iron concentration are seen in hemolytic anaemias, hemochromatosis and acute liver disease. Serum Iron alone is
unreliable due to considerable physiologic diurnal variation in the results with highest values in the morning and lowest values in
the evening as well as variation in response to iron therapy .

Total Iron Binding capacity (TIBC) is a direct measure of the protein Transferrin which transports iron from the gut to storage
sites in the bone marrow. Increased levels of TIBC suggest that total iron body stores are low, increased concentration may be
the sign of Iron deficiency anaemia, polycythemia vera ,and may occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. Decreased levels
may be seen in hemolytic anaemia, hemochromatosis, chronic liver disease, hypoproteinemia ,malnutrition.

Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC) is increased in low iron state and decreased in high iron concentration such as
hemochromatosis. In case of anaemia of chronic disease the patient may be anaemic but has adequate iron reserve and a low
uIBC.

Transferrin Saturation occurs in Idiopathic hemochromatosis and Transfusional hemosiderosis where no unsaturated iron
binding capacity is available for iron mobilization. Similar condition is seen in congenital deficiency of Transferrin.

Comment:

eLipid profile measurements in the same patient can show physiological & analytical variations. It is recommended that 3 serial
samples 1 week apart may be tested.

eIndians are at a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); at a much earlier age and more severe
with high mortality. Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid profile) is the major risk factor and found in almost 80% Indians.

eTotal cholesterol is the total amount of cholesterol in blood comprising of HDL, LDL-C, and VLDL.

eLDL Cholesterol (LDL-C) or “bad”cholesterol contributes most significantly to atherosclerosis leading to heart disease or
stroke and is the primary target for reducing risk for cardiovascular disease.

eHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol can lower risk of heart disease and stroke.

eTriglyceride (TG) level also plays a major role in CVD. Indians are more prone to Atherogenic dyslipidemia, a condition
associated with high TG, low HDL-C and high LDL-C; this is associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
Hence high triglyceride levels also need to be treated.

eNon-HDL-Cholesterol (Non-HDLC) measures all plaque forming lipoproteins (e.g. remnants, LDL-C, VLDL, Lp(a), Apo-B).
Monitoring of Non-HDLC is important in patients with high TG (e.g. diabetics, obese persons) and those already on statin
therapy.

eLipid Association of India (LAI-2020) recommends:-

e Screening of all Indians above the age of 20 years for CVD risk factors, esp. lipid profile.

e Identification of Risk factors: Age (male =45 years, female =55 years); Family h/o heart disease at younger age (<55 yrs
in males, <65 yrs in female), Smoking/tobacco use, High blood pressure, Low HDL (males <40 mg/dl and females
<50mg/dl).

e Fasting lipid profile is not mandatory for screening. Both fasting and non-fasting lipid profiles are equally important for
managing Indian patients.

e Non-HDLC should be calculated in every subject. LAI recommends LDL-C as the primary target and Non-HDLC as the co-
primary target for initiating drug therapy.

e Lifestyle modifications are of first and foremost importance for management and prevention of dyslipidemia. Among low
risk groups, treatment is started only after 3 months of lifestyle changes.

® Testing for Apolipoprotein B, hsCRP, Lp(a ) should be considered for patients in moderate risk group.

@As per NCEP Expert Panel (2011) guidelines, universal screening for dyslipidemia is recommended for children between 9
- 11 yrs (repeat at 17-21 yrs). Screening is not recommended before the age of 2yrs. Above the age of 2 yrs, selective screening
is done in children with family history of premature CVD or risk factors like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.

© LFTS are based upon measurements of substances released from damaged hepatic cells into the blood that gives idea of
the Existence, Extent and Type of Liver damage. - Acute Hepatocellular damage: ALT & AST levels are sensitive index of

@ Bilirubin results from the enzymatic breakdown of heme. Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous
membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia.

@ Pre-hepatic or hemolytic jaundice - Abnormal red cells, antibodies,drugs and toxins,Hemoglobinopathies, Gilbert’s
syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome

® Hepatic or Hepatocellular jaundice-Viral hepatitis,toxic hepatitis, intrahepatic cholestasis

® Post-hepatic jaundice -Extrahepatic cholestasis, gallstones, tumors of the bile duct, carcinoma of pancreas

® In viral hepatitis and other forms of liver disease associated with acute hepatic necrosis, serum AST and ALT
concentrations are elevated even before the clinical signs and symptoms of disease appear.

® ALT is the more liver-specific enzyme and elevations of ALT activity persist longer than AST activity.

® Peak values of aminotransferase activity occur between the seventh and twelfth days. Activities then gradually decrease,
reaching normal activities by the third to fifth week. Peak activities bear no relationship to prognosis and may fall with
worsening of the patient's condition.

@ Aminotransferase activities observed in cirrhosis vary with the status of the cirrhotic process and range from the upper
reference limit to four to five times higher, with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1. The ratio's elevation can reflect the grade
of fibrosis in these patients. Slight or moderate elevations of both AST and ALT activities have been observed after
administration of various medications and chronic hepatic injury such as (1) hemochromatosis, (2) Wilson disease, (3)
autoimmune hepatitis, (4) primary biliary cirrhosis, (5) sclerosing cholangitis, and (6) ai1-antitrypsin deficiency.

® AST activity also is increased in acute myocardial infarction, progressive muscular dystrophy and dermatomyositis, reaching
concentrations up to eight times the upper reference limit.Slight to moderate AST elevations are noted in hemolytic

disease.

BUN/Creatinine Ratio 17.0 Ratio 12.1 - 20.1 Calculated

Comment:

BUN is directly related to protein intake and nitrogen metabolism and inversely related to the rate of excretion of urea.Blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) levels reflect the balance between the production and excretion of urea. Increased levels are seen in renal
failure (acute or chronic), urinary tract obstruction, dehydration, shock, burns, CHF, GI bleeding, nephrotoxic drugs. Decreased
levels are seen in hepatic failure, nephrotic syndrome, cachexia (low-protein and high-carbohydrate diets).

Urea is a non-proteinous nitrogen compound formed in the liver from ammonia as an end product of protein metabolism. Urea
diffuses freely into extracellular and intracellular fluid and is ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Increased levels are found in
acute renal failure, chronic glomerulonephritis, congestive heart failure, decreased renal perfusion, diabetes, excessive protein
ingestion, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hyperalimentation, hypovolemia, ketoacidosis, muscle wasting from starvation,
neoplasms, pyelonephritis, shock, urinary tract obstruction, nephrotoxic drugs. Decreased levels are seen in inadequate dietary
protein, low-protein/high-carbohydrate diet, malabsorption syndromes, pregnancy, severe liver disease, certain drugs.
Creatinine is catabolic product of creatinine phosphate, which is excreted by filtration through the glomerulus and by tubular
secretion. Creatinine clearance is an acceptable clinical measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Increased levels are seen in
acute/chronic renal failure, urinary tract obstruction, hypothyroidism, nephrotoxic drugs, shock, dehydration, congestive heart
failure, diabetes. Decreased levels are found in muscular dystrophy.

BUN/Creatinine ratio (normally 12:1-20:1) is decreased in acute tubular necrosis, advanced liver disease, low protein intake,
and following hemodialysis. BUN/Creatinine ratio is increased in dehydration, GI bleeding, and increased catabolism.

Uric acid levels show diurnal variation. The level is usually higher in the morning and lower in the evening. Increased levels are
seen in starvation, strenuous exercise, malnutrition, or lead poisoning, gout, renal disorders, increased breakdown of body cells
in some cancers (including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) or cancer treatments, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell
anemia, or heart failure, pre-eclampsia, liver disease (cirrhosis), obesity, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, low blood levels of
parathyroid hormone (PTH), certain drugs, foods that are very high in purines - such as organ meats, red meats, some seafood

and beer. Decreased levels are seen in liver disease, Wilson's disease, Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH),
certain drugs.

® TSH levels are subject to circadian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4.a.m. and at a minimum between 6-10 pm

© The variation is of the order of 50%, hence time of the day has influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.

® TSH is secreted in a dual fashion: Intermittent pulses constitute 60-70% of total amount, background continuous secretion
is 30-40%.These pulses occur regularly every 1-3 hrs.

® Total T3 & T4 concentrations are altered by physiological or pathological changes in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)
capacity .

® The determination of free T3 & free T4 has the advantage of being independent of changes in the concentrations and
binding properties of the binding proteins.

® Changes in thyroid status are typically associated with concordant changes in T3, T4 and TSH levels.

Unexpectedly abnormal or discordant thyroid test values may be seen with some rare, but clinically significant conditions

such as central hypothyroidism, TSH-secreting pituitary tumors, thyroid hormone resistance, or the presence of

heterophilic antibodies (HAMA) or thyroid hormone autoantibodies.

® For diagnostic purposes, results should be used in conjunction with other data.

Vitamin D (25-OH)
Vitamin D (25-OH) 30.5 ng/ml Deficiency:< 20, CLIA
Insufficiency:20-29,
Sufficiency:30 - 100,
Toxicity possible:> 100
Comment:

® Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid prohormone involved in the intestinal absorption of calcium and the regulation of calcium
homeostasis.

® Two forms of vitamin D are biologically relevant - vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol).

@ Both vitamins D3 and D2 can be absorbed from food but only an estimated 10-20perc. of vitamin D is supplied through
nutritional intake.

®@ Vitamin D is converted to the active hormone 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D (Calcitriol) through two hydroxylation reactions. The
first hydroxylation converts vitamin D into 25-OH vitamin D and occurs in the liver. The second hydroxylation converts 25-
OH vitamin D into the biologically active 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D and occurs in the kidneys as well as in many other cells of
the body.

® Most cells express the vitamin D receptor and about 3perc. of the human genome is directly or indirectly regulated by the
vitamin D endocrine system.

@ The major storage form of vitamin D is 25-OH vitamin D and is present in the blood at up to 1,000 fold higher
concentration compared to the active 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. 25-OH vitamin D has a half-life of 2-3 weeks vs. 4 hours for
1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. Therefore, 25-OH vitamin D is the analyte of choice for determination of the vitamin D status.

® Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include low sun exposure, inadequate intake, decreased absorption, abnormal
metabolism, vitamin D resistance and and liver or kidney diseases.

® Vitamin D deficiency is a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism and diseases resulting in impaired bone metabolism (like
rickets, osteomalacia).

Comment:

eNote: Pre-test condition to be observed while submitting the sample-first void, mid stream urine, collected in a clean, dry, sterile
container is recommended for routine urine analysis, avoid contamination with any discharge from vaginal, urethra, perineum,
Avoid prolonged transit time & undue exposure to sunlight.

During interpretation, points to be considered are Negative nitrite test does not exclude the urinary tract infections. Trace
proteinuria can be seen with many physiological conditions like prolonged recumbency, exercise, high protein diet. False positive
reactions for bile pigments, proteins, glucose and nitrites can be caused by peroxidase like activity by disinfectants, therapeutic
dyes, ascorbic acid and certain drugs.® Urine microscopy is done in centrifuged urine specimens
