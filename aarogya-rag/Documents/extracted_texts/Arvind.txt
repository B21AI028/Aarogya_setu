Comment:

® ESR provides an index of progress of the disease and is widely used as an indicator of inflammation, infection, trauma, or
malignant diseases. Changes are more significant than a single abnormal test

® It is specifically indicated to monitor the course or response to the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis,
tuberculosis bacterial endocarditis ,acute rheumatic fever ,Hodgkins disease,temporal arthritis , and systemic lupus
erythematosis; and to diagnose and monitor giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica.

@ An elevated ESR may also be associated with many other conditions, including autoimmune disease, anemia,
infection,malignancy,pregnancy, multiple myeloma, menstruation, and hypothyroidism.

@ Although a normal ESR cannot be taken to exclude the presence of organic disease, its rate is dependent on various
physiologic and pathologic factors.

® The most important component influencing ESR is the composition of plasma. High level of C-Reactive Protein, fibrinogen,
haptoglobin, alpha-1antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin and immunoglobulins causes the elevation of Erythrocyte Sedimentation
Rate.

® Drugs that may cause increase ESR levels include: dextran, methyldopa, oral contraceptives, penicillamine, procainamide,
theophylline, and Vitamin A. Drugs that may cause decrease levels include: aspirin, cortisone, and quinine

Comment:
Interpretation: HbA1c%

5.7-6.4 At Risk For Diabetes

Adapted from American Diabetes Association.

Comments:

A 3 to 6 monthly monitoring is recommended in diabetics. People with diabetes should get the test done more often if their blood
sugar stays too high or if their healthcare provider makes any change in the treatment plan. HbAic concentration represent the
integrated values for blood glucose over the preceding 8-12 weeks and is not affected by daily glucose fluctuation, exercise &
recent food intake.

Please note, Glycemic goal should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions,
known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.

Factors that interfere with HbAic Measurement: Hemoglobin variants, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and chemically modified
derivatives of hemoglobin (e.g. carbamylated Hb in patients with renal failure) can affect the accuracy of HbA1lc measurements.

Factors that affect interpretation of HbAic Measurement: Any condition that shortens erythrocyte survival or decrease mean
erythrocyte age (e. g., recovery from acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC) will falsely lower HbA1c test
results regardless of the assay method used. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with higher HbAtic.

Note: Presence of Hemoglobin variants and/or conditions that affect red cell turnover must be considered, particularly when the
HbAic result does not correlate with the patient's blood glucose levels.

Comment:

eLipid profile measurements in the same patient can show physiological & analytical variations. It is recommended that 3 serial
samples 1 week apart may be tested.

eIndians are at a high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); at a much earlier age and more severe
with high mortality. Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid profile) is the major risk factor and found in almost 80% Indians.

eTotal cholesterol is the total amount of cholesterol in blood comprising of HDL, LDL-C, and VLDL.

eLDL Cholesterol (LDL-C) or “bad”cholesterol contributes most significantly to atherosclerosis leading to heart disease or
stroke and is the primary target for reducing risk for cardiovascular disease.

eHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” cholesterol can lower risk of heart disease and stroke.

eTriglyceride (TG) level also plays a major role in CVD. Indians are more prone to Atherogenic dyslipidemia, a condition
associated with high TG, low HDL-C and high LDL-C; this is associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
Hence high triglyceride levels also need to be treated.

@Non-HDL-Cholesterol (Non-HDLC) measures all plaque forming lipoproteins (e.g. remnants, LDL-C, VLDL, Lp(a), Apo-B).
Monitoring of Non-HDLC is important in patients with high TG (e.g. diabetics, obese persons) and those already on statin
therapy.

eLipid Association of India (LAI-2020) recommends:-

® Screening of all Indians above the age of 20 years for CVD risk factors, esp. lipid profile.

e Identification of Risk factors: Age (male 245 years, female =55 years); Family h/o heart disease at younger age (<55 yrs
in males, <65 yrs in female), Smoking/tobacco use, High blood pressure, Low HDL (males <40 mg/dl and females
<50mg/dl).

e Fasting lipid profile is not mandatory for screening. Both fasting and non-fasting lipid profiles are equally important for
managing Indian patients.

@ Non-HDLC should be calculated in every subject. LAI recommends LDL-C as the primary target and Non-HDLC as the co-
primary target for initiating drug therapy.

e Lifestyle modifications are of first and foremost importance for management and prevention of dyslipidemia. Among low
risk groups, treatment is started only after 3 months of lifestyle changes.

e Testing for Apolipoprotein B, hsCRP, Lp(a ) should be considered for patients in moderate risk group.

e Newer treatment goals based on Risk Groups and values of LDL-C and Non-HDLC

Comment:

® Raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular damage (e.g. viral or drugs etc). ALT is more liver-specific while AST is also
found in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Mild elevation (less than twice normal) often resolves on its own. Fatty liver
disease (especially with metabolic syndrome) is a common cause in asymptomatic cases. Certain drugs (paracetamol,
statins), herbal supplements, energy drinks, and antibiotics may also affect liver function.

® SGOT/SGPT Ratio: Typically <1 in healthy individuals (vary between 0.7-1.4; higher in women than men). High SGPT (ratio
<1) seen in acute or chronic hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, medications, toxins while ratio >1 indicates alcoholic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, metastasis or non-hepatic issues (hemolytic diseases, CVS disorders).

@ Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase and GGT: Suggest cholestatic diseases (e.g. bile duct obstruction, primary biliary

Phosphorus, Serum

Phosphorus, Serum 2.50 mg/dl 2.4-5.1 Phosphomolybdate

Comment:

Phosphate metabolism is under the regulation of PTH, Vitamin D metabolites, and Fibroblast growth factor-23.
Serum phosphate concentrations are about 50% higher in infants than in adults and decline throughout childhood as a
consequence of the ability of growth hormone to increase the renal phosphate threshold.

Increased in:

Decreased Renal filtraton (Acute or chronic renal failure) or increased reabsorption (e.g., hypoparathyroidism)

Increased Phosphate load (e.g., Oral or iv administration, Phosphate-containing laxatives or enemas, Vitamin D intoxication)
Cell Lysis (e.g., hemolysis, leukemias, chemotherapy, rhabdomyolysis)

Bone disease (e.g., healing fractures, multiple myeloma, Paget disease, osteolytic tumors)

Genetic (e.g., Hypoparathyroidism, Tumoral calcinosis)

Decreased in:

Intracellular Shift (e.g., Oral or intravenous Glucose, Insulin, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Respiratory alkalosis, Alcoholism, Severe
burns)

Lowered Renal Phosphate Threshold (e.g., Primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, Renal tubular defects)

Decreased Intestinal Absorption (Malabsorption syndrome, Vitamin D deficiency) or increased loss (Vomiting, Diarrhea)
Drugs (e.g., Salicylate, Paracetamol, Estrogens, Diuretics, Bisphosphonates, Anticonvulsants, Phosphate binding antacids,
Antiviral drugs etc)

Note:
Because a significant diurnal variation in plasma phosphate has been reported, fasting morning specimens are recommended.
Levels are influenced by dietary intake, meals, and exercise.

Transferrin saturation 18.96 % 16-50 Calculated

Ferritin 220.00 ng/mL 22 - 322 CLIA

Comment:

Iron is an essential trace mineral element which forms an important component of hemoglobin, metallocompounds and Vitamin A.
Deficiency of iron is seen in iron deficiency and anaemia of chronic disorders.

Increased iron concentration are seen in hemolytic anaemias, hemochromatosis and acute liver disease. Serum Iron alone is
unreliable due to considerable physiologic diurnal variation in the results with highest values in the morning and lowest values in
the evening as well as variation in response to iron therapy .

Total Iron Binding capacity (TIBC) is a direct measure of the protein Transferrin which transports iron from the gut to storage

sites in the bone marrow. Increased levels of TIBC suggest that total iron body stores are low, increased concentration may be
the sign of Iron deficiency anaemia, polycythemia vera ,and may occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. Decreased levels
may be seen in hemolytic anaemia, hemochromatosis, chronic liver disease, hypoproteinemia ,malnutrition.

Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC) is increased in low iron state and decreased in high iron concentration such as

hemochromatosis. In case of anaemia of chronic disease the patient may be anaemic but has adequate iron reserve and a low
uIBC.

Transferrin Saturation occurs in Idiopathic hemochromatosis and Transfusional hemosiderosis where no unsaturated iron
binding capacity is available for iron mobilization. Similar condition is seen in congenital deficiency of Transferrin.

*Please note change in BRI of Ferritin.

Lipase

Lipase 37.0 ULL 12-53 Colorimetric rate

Comment:

Pancreas is the major and primary source of serum lipase, though lipase is also secreted by the gastric and intestinal mucosa.
Lipase measurement in serum is used to diagnose acute pancreatitis.

After an attack of acute pancreatitis, serum Lipase activity increases within 4 to 8 hours,peaks at about 24 hours, and decreases
over 8 to 14 days. Concentrations often remain elevated longer than those of Amylase.The increase in serum Lipase activity is
not necessarily proportional to the severity of the attack.

Increased levels are seen in:

® Acute & Chronic Pancreatitis.

® Obstruction of Pancreatic duct.

® Non pancreatic conditions like renal disease,intestinal obstruction,acute cholecystitis,duodenal ulcer,alcoholism,diabetic
ketoacidosis and following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP).

Amylase
Amylase 86 UL 30.0 - 118.0 Ethylidene Blocked-
pNPG7
Comment:

@ Amylase is a digestive enzyme mainly secreted by pancreas and salivary glands.

® An elevation of serum amylase beyond three times the upper limit of normal, combined with either clinical symptoms
and/or imaging findings, may indicate acute pancreatitis. Serum amylase levels typically rise within 6 to 48 hours and
usually return to baseline within 3 to 7 days. However, because of its short half-life, amylase levels may normalize as
quickly as 24 hours after onset. Additionally, around 20% of patients with acute pancreatitis may have normal or near-
normal amylase levels. Therefore, lipase, which is more specific to pancreatitis, should be measured alongside amylase to
improve diagnostic accuracy.

® Elevated amylase levels can also be associated with conditions such as pancreatic duct obstruction, pancreatic carcinoma,
or pancreatic pseudocysts. Additionally, increased amylase levels may occur in cholecystitis, renal disease, acute alcohol
poisoning, following procedures like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and even in non-pancreatic
conditions like penetrating peptic ulcers, duodenal obstruction, mumps, ectopic pregnancy, and severe diabetic

® In asymptomatic individuals, elevated amylase levels may be attributed to macroamylasemia or idiopathic
hyperamylasemia; amylase levels may fluctuate. Transient increases in amylase may also result from inflammation, alcohol
consumption, or medications such as aspirin, diuretics, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, indomethacin, and opiates.

® Low amylase levels are seen in chronic pancreatitis, congestive heart failure, 2nd & 3rd trimester of pregnancy,
gastrointestinal cancer & bone fractures. Highly lipemic samples may show falsely low amylase levels.

Lipoprotein (a)

Lipoprotein(a) 16.05 mg/dL <30 Latex microparticle-
enhanced
immunoturbidimetry

Comment:

Note: Lipoprotein(a)[ Lp(a)] is considered an important risk factor for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

* Lipoprotein (a) consists of an LDL particle that is covalently bound to an additional protein, apolipoprotein (a). Apo(a) has
high-sequence homology with the coagulation factor plasminogen and, like LDL, Lp(a) contains apolipoprotein B100 . Thus, Lp(a)
is both proatherogenic and prothrombotic. Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for CHD, Ischemic Stroke, and Aortic Valve
Stenosis.

* Lp(a) is highly heterogeneous molecule; the degree of atherogenicity of the Lp(a) particle may depend on the molecular size of
the Lp(a)-specific protein.

* Serum concentrations of Lp(a) are related to genetic factors, and are largely unaffected by diet, exercise and lipid -lowering
pharmaceuticals. However, in a patient with additional modifiable CHD risk factors, more aggressive therapy to normalize these
factors may be indicated if the Lp(a) value is also increased.

Usage:

Evaluation of increased risk for cardiovascular disease and events:
* In individuals at intermediate risk for cardiovascular disease

* In patients with early atherosclerosis

* In patients with strong family history of early CHD

Comment:

High Sensitivity C- Reactive protein (hs-CRP)is used as a marker for determining and performing risk assessment of
cardiovascular disease (good marker for inflammation), often along with tests for Lipid profile.
The American Heart Association and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined risk groups as follows:

<1.0 Low Risk
1.0 - 3.0 - Average Risk
>3.0 High Risk

These values are only a part of the total evaluation process for cardiovascular diseases.
To assess vascular risk ,it is recommended to test hSCRP levels 2 or more weeks apart and calculate the average

Additional risk factors to be considered are elevated levels of lipids & glucose, smoking, high blood pressure (hypertension).

Anti inflammatory drugs (like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) or statins may reduce CRP levels in blood. It is important that any
person undergoing this test must be in a healthy state in order for the results to be of diagnostic value in predicting the risk of
coronary artery disease or heart attack. Any recent illness, tissue injury, infection, or other general inflammation will raise the
amount of hsCRP and give a falsely elevated estimate of risk.

Women on hormone replacement therapy have been shown to have elevated hs-CRP levels.

Note:
Since the hs-CRP and CRP tests measure the same molecule, people with chronic inflammation, such as those with arthritis,

should not have hs-CRP levels measured. Their CRP levels will be very high due to the arthritis/often too high to be measured or
meaningful using the hs-CRP test.

® Apolipoproteins Ai (Apo Al) is the major apolipoprotein attached to HDL and is found in greater proportion than Apo A2
(3:1).

® It is inversely related to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).

® Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) is a major protein component of low density lipoprotien (LDL), Comprising >90% of the LDL. It is a
more powerful independent predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD) than LDL cholesterol. It is useful in assessing the
risk of CAD and to classify Hyperlipidemias.

® Apolipoprotein studies help in monitoring coronary bypass surgery patients with regard to risk and severity of
restenosis.They are also useful in assessing risk of re-infarction in patients with Myocardial infarction .

* In patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (HALB), a disorder associated with increased risk of developing CHD and
with an estimated prevalence of 30% in patients with premature CAD, Apo B is increased disproportionately in LDL
cholesterol. Apo B quantitation is used in distinguishing HALB from another common lipoprotein abnormality, Familial
combined hyperlipidemia.

Comment:
eC-Reactive Protein [CRP] is an acute phase reactant ,hepatic secretion of which is stimulated in response to inflammatory
cytokines.

CRP is a very sensitive but nonspecific marker of inflammation and infection.

eThe CRP test is useful in patient with Inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, Autoimmune diseases, Pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID), tissue injury or necrosis and infections.

CRP levels can be elevated in the later stages of pregnancy as well as with use of birth control pills or hormone replacement
therapy i.e. estrogen. Higher levels of CRP have also been observed in the obese.
eAs compared to ESR, CRP shows an earlier rise in inflammatory disorders which begins in 4-6 hrs, he intensity of the rise being

higher than ESR and the recovery being earlier than ESR. Unlike ESR, CRP levels are not influenced by hematologic conditions
like Anemia, Polycythemia.

Rheumatoid Factor - Quantitative
Rheumatoid Factor - Quantitative 4.5 TU/AnL 0-14 Turbidimetry

Comment:

The detection of Rheumatoid factor (RF) is one of the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) for the
diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

@ RF are heterogeneous group of auto antibodies directed against Fc- region of IgG molecules.

They are useful in diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis, but can also be found in other inflammatory diseases and in various
non-rheumatic diseases.

These occur in all the immunoglobulin classes, although the usual analytical methods are limited to the detection of
Rheumatoid Factors of the IgM type.Healthy individuals >65 years of age may also show positive RF results.

(Source- American Diabetes Association (ADA):Standards of Care in Diabetes-2024)

® As per ADA, due to high biological variability (>20%) between measurements of urinary albumin excretion; two out of
three specimens collected within a 3-to 6-month period should be abnormal before considering albuminuria (after
excluding non-renal causes).

® Certain factors may raise UACR even without kidney damage - physiological like exercise within 24 hours, menstruation,
pregnancy, benign postural proteinuria or pathological like infection (UTI), hematuria, fever, marked hyperglycemia,
congestive heart failure, marked hypertension & poor metabolic control. A high albumin-to-creatinine ratio can be due to
low urinary creatinine seen in females, low muscle mass, low protein intake or acute kidney injury.

© Arandom spot urine sample can be used, but due to high variability, it is recommended that abnormal UACR (>= 30
mg/g) should be confirmed with subsequent first morning midstream sample or 24 hr urine collection.

® Due to inherent day to day variability in albumin excretion, UACR is a better indicator than urine albumin alone.
Microalbuminuria is defined as the small but abnormal increase in the excretion of urinary albumin (30-300 mg/g
creatinine), but it is recommended to use the term albuminuria for ACR >= 30 mg/g creatinine.

® Persistent albuminuria present for a minimum of 3 months is one of the diagnostic markers of kidney damage and used for
classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Clinical Utility: Useful in early screening of diabetic nephropathy, as a risk marker for stroke & heart disease and also for
classification and progression of CKD.

@ Below mentioned are the guidelines for pregnancy related reference ranges for TSH, total T3 & Total T4.

Pregnancy

TSH (uIU/mL) (as per
American Thyroid Total T3 (ng/mL) Total T4(ug/dL)
Association )

0.81-1.90
andtrimester_—__—[0.2-3.0 1.00-2.60
3rd trimester —«*|0..3-3.0 1.00-2.60 6.95-15.7

TSH levels are subject to circadian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4.a.m. and at a minimum between 6-10 pm

© The variation is of the order of 50%, hence time of the day has influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.

@ TSH is secreted in a dual fashion: Intermittent pulses constitute 60-70% of total amount, background continuous secretion
is 30-40%.These pulses occur regularly every 1-3 hrs.

® Total T3 & T4 concentrations are altered by physiological or pathological changes in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)

capacity .

The determination of free T3 & free T4 has the advantage of being independent of changes in the concentrations and

binding properties of the binding proteins.

® Changes in thyroid status are typically associated with concordant changes in T3, T4 and TSH levels.

Unexpectedly abnormal or discordant thyroid test values may be seen with some rare, but clinically significant conditions

such as central hypothyroidism, TSH-secreting pituitary tumors, thyroid hormone resistance, or the presence of

heterophilic antibodies (HAMA) or thyroid hormone autoantibodies.

® For diagnostic purposes, results should be used in conjunction with other data.

® FT4 is the biologically active fraction of thyroxine in circulating blood.

In patients with hyperthyroidism, the FT4 concentration increases, whereas in patients with hypothyroidism it generally
decreases.

Patients on hormone replacement therapy may have an elevation of FT4, although clinically they are euthyroid.

The determination of free T4 has the advantage of being independent of changes in the concentrations and binding
properties of the binding proteins.

For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patient’s medical history, clinical
examination and other findings.

Vitamin D (25-OH)
Vitamin D (25-OH) 30.5 ng/mL Deficiency:< 20, CLIA
Insufficiency:20-29,
Sufficiency:30 - 100,
Toxicity possible:> 100
Comment:

® Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid prohormone involved in the intestinal absorption of calcium and the regulation of calcium
homeostasis.

® Two forms of vitamin D are biologically relevant - vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (Ergocalciferol).

® Both vitamins D3 and D2 can be absorbed from food but only an estimated 10-20perc. of vitamin D is supplied through
nutritional intake.

®@ Vitamin D is converted to the active hormone 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D (Calcitriol) through two hydroxylation reactions. The
first hydroxylation converts vitamin D into 25-OH vitamin D and occurs in the liver. The second hydroxylation converts 25-
OH vitamin D into the biologically active 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D and occurs in the kidneys as well as in many other cells of
the body.

® Most cells express the vitamin D receptor and about 3perc. of the human genome is directly or indirectly regulated by the
vitamin D endocrine system.

@ The major storage form of vitamin D is 25-OH vitamin D and is present in the blood at up to 1,000 fold higher
concentration compared to the active 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. 25-OH vitamin D has a half-life of 2-3 weeks vs. 4 hours for
1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D. Therefore, 25-OH vitamin D is the analyte of choice for determination of the vitamin D status.

@ Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include low sun exposure, inadequate intake, decreased absorption, abnormal
metabolism, vitamin D resistance and and liver or kidney diseases.

@ Vitamin D deficiency is a cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism and diseases resulting in impaired bone metabolism (like
rickets, osteomalacia).

® Recently, many chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and several autoimmune diseases
have been linked to vitamin D deficiency.

® The assay measures both D2 (Ergocalciferol) and D3 (Cholecalciferol) metabolites of vitamin D

Utility Quantitative determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH vitamin D).

Vitamin B12 248.0 pg/ml 211-911 CLIA

Comment:

® Vitamin B12 along with folate is essential for DNA synthesis and myelin formation.

® Decreased levels are seen in anaemia, term pregnancy, vegetarian diet, intrinsic factor deficiency, partial
gastrectomy/ileal damage, celiac disease, oral contraceptive use, parasitic infestation, pancreatic deficiency, treated
epilepsy, smoking, hemodialysis and advanced age.

© Increased levels are seen in renal failure, hepatocelluar disorders, myeloproliferative disorders and at times with excess
supplementation of vitamins pills.

Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid) 16.42 ng/ml 0.35-3.37 Deficient CLIA
3.38-5.38 Indeterminate
>5.38 Normal
Comment:

Folate plays an important role in the synthesis of purine & pyrimidines in the body and is important for the maturation of
erythrocytes. It is widely available from plants and to a lesser extent organ meats, but more than half the folate content of food
is lost during cooking. Folate deficiency is commonly prevalent in alcoholic liver disease, pregnancy, and the elderly. It may result
from poor intestinal absorption, nutrition deficiency, excessive demand as in pregnancy or in malignancy, and in response to
certain drugs like Methotrexate & anticonvulsants. It is now routine practice to recommend dietary folate supplements from
conception to the 12th week of pregnancy; such supplementation has been proven to reduce the incidence of neural tube
defects.

Decreased Levels: Megaloblastic anemia, Infantile hyperthyroidism, Alcoholism, Malnutrition, Scurvy, Liver disease, B12
deficiency, dietary amino acid excess, adult Celiac disease, Tropical Sprue, Crohn’s disease, Hemolytic anemias, Carcinomas,
Myelofibrosis, vitamin B6 deficiency, pregnancy, Whipple’s disease, extensive intestinal resection, and severe exfoliative
dermatitis.

Note:

Certain drugs like Pyrimethamine, methotrexate, and trimethoprim are all folate antagonists i.e. they stop the action of the folic
acid; phenytoin can decrease the intestinal absorption of folates, and ethanol both decreases absorption and increases
excretion of folic acid.

To differentiate vitamin B12 & folate deficiency, measurement of Methylmalonic acid in urine & serum Homocysteine level is
suggested.

Homocysteine 41.24 umol/L <15 CLIA
Comment:
Interpertation:

Increased levels are seen in deranged Vit B12 metabolism and form an independent marker for risk of thromboembolic episodes
in coronary artery disease (CAD)

Clinical Utility:

eDetermine risk for heart disease, stroke and peripheral arterial blood vessel disease.
eIdentify vitamin B12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency.

eIdentify homocystinuria

The recommended use of Homocysteine (HCY) to assess risk factor for CAD are

elt is specially useful in young CAD patients (<40 years)

eIn known cases of CAD,high HCYlevels should be used as a prognostic marker for CAD events and mortality.
eCAD patients with HCY levels >15 umol/L belong to high risk group.

eIncreased HCY levels with low vitamin concentrations should be handled as a potential vitamin deficiency case .

High values of HCY are found in dietary deficiency of folic acid, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12, homocystinuria, chronic liver and
renal failure,post menopausal state , hypothyroidism, Alzheimer's disease,vaious neoplastic disease like cancers of ovary or
breast and Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,drugs (anti-anticonvulsants, antibiotics, theophylline, birth control pills, and
tamoxifen),alcoholism, smoking or tobacco usage.

Low values may be caused by some medicines or vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B12, or niacin.
