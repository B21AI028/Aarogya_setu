Rh Factor Positive
Comment:

Blood group is identified by antigens and antibodies present in the blood. Antigens are protein molecules found on the surface of
red blood cells. Antibodies are found in plasma. To determine blood group, red cells are mixed with different antibody solutions
to give A,B,O or AB. The test is performed by both forward as well as reverse grouping methods. The report is of sample
received. It is presumed that the sample belongs to the patient.

Notes

Reconfirm the Blood Group & Rh Typing along with cross matching before blood transfusion.

Recent blood transfusion, if any, interferes with interpretation of blood grouping.

The blood group and Rh antigen may change in the new born, hence please repeat the test after 6 months.
Subgroups and Bombay blood group needs to be further verified

Comment:
Interpretation: HbA1c%

5.7-6.4 At Risk For Diabetes

Adapted from American Diabetes Association.

Comments:

A 3 to 6 monthly monitoring is recommended in diabetics. People with diabetes should get the test done more often if their blood
sugar stays too high or if their healthcare provider makes any change in the treatment plan. HbAic concentration represent the
integrated values for blood glucose over the preceding 8-12 weeks and is not affected by daily glucose fluctuation, exercise &
recent food intake.

Please note, Glycemic goal should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions,
known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.

Factors that interfere with HbAic Measurement: Hemoglobin variants, elevated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and chemically modified
derivatives of hemoglobin (e.g. carbamylated Hb in patients with renal failure) can affect the accuracy of HbAic measurements.

Factors that affect interpretation of HbAic Measurement: Any condition that shortens erythrocyte survival or decrease mean
erythrocyte age (e. g., recovery from acute blood loss, hemolytic anemia, HbSS, HbCC, and HbSC) will falsely lower HbAic test
results regardless of the assay method used. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with higher HbAic.

Note: Presence of Hemoglobin variants and/or conditions that affect red cell turnover must be considered, particularly when the
HbAic result does not correlate with the patient's blood glucose levels.

Comment:

e

Raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular damage (e.g. viral or drugs etc). ALT is more liver-specific while AST is also
found in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Mild elevation (less than twice normal) often resolves on its own. Fatty liver
disease (especially with metabolic syndrome) is a common cause in asymptomatic cases. Certain drugs (paracetamol,
statins), herbal supplements, energy drinks, and antibiotics may also affect liver function.

SGOT/SGPT Ratio: Typically <1 in healthy individuals (vary between 0.7-1.4; higher in women than men). High SGPT (ratio
<1) seen in acute or chronic hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, medications, toxins while ratio >1 indicates alcoholic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, metastasis or non-hepatic issues (hemolytic diseases, CVS disorders).

Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase and GGT: Suggest cholestatic diseases (e.g. bile duct obstruction, primary biliary
cirrhosis etc.) and can also be due to bone disease, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, malignancy, and congestive heart
failure.

High Bilirubin: Indicates jaundice due to increased RBC breakdown, liver damage (e.g., infections, toxins), or cholestasis
(e.g., gallstones, tumors).

High Protein Levels: Seen in dehydration (e.g., severe vomiting, diarrhea) or increased production (e.g., inflammation,
hematopoietic neoplasms). Low protein and albumin: Result from impaired synthesis (liver disease), decreased intake,
tissue damage, malabsorption, or increased renal excretion.

Chloride 108.0 mEq/L 98-107 Indirect ISE
BUN/Creatinine Ratio 15.9 Ratio 12:1 - 20:1 Calculated
Comment:

BUN is directly related to protein intake and nitrogen metabolism and inversely related to the rate of excretion of urea.Blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) levels reflect the balance between the production and excretion of urea. Increased levels are seen in renal
failure (acute or chronic), urinary tract obstruction, dehydration, shock, burns, CHF, GI bleeding, nephrotoxic drugs. Decreased
levels are seen in hepatic failure, nephrotic syndrome, cachexia (low-protein and high-carbohydrate diets).

Urea is a non-proteinous nitrogen compound formed in the liver from ammonia as an end product of protein metabolism. Urea
diffuses freely into extracellular and intracellular fluid and is ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Increased levels are found in
acute renal failure, chronic glomerulonephritis, congestive heart failure, decreased renal perfusion, diabetes, excessive protein
ingestion, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, hyperalimentation, hypovolemia, ketoacidosis, muscle wasting from starvation,
neoplasms, pyelonephritis, shock, urinary tract obstruction, nephrotoxic drugs. Decreased levels are seen in inadequate dietary
protein, low-protein/high-carbohydrate diet, malabsorption syndromes, pregnancy, severe liver disease, certain drugs.
Creatinine is catabolic product of creatinine phosphate, which is excreted by filtration through the glomerulus and by tubular
secretion. Creatinine clearance is an acceptable clinical measure of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Increased levels are seen in
acute/chronic renal failure, urinary tract obstruction, hypothyroidism, nephrotoxic drugs, shock, dehydration, congestive heart
failure, diabetes. Decreased levels are found in muscular dystrophy.

BUN/Creatinine ratio (normally 12:1-20:1) is decreased in acute tubular necrosis, advanced liver disease, low protein intake,
and following hemodialysis. BUN/Creatinine ratio is increased in dehydration, GI bleeding, and increased catabolism.

Uric acid levels show diurnal variation. The level is usually higher in the morning and lower in the evening. Increased levels are
seen in starvation, strenuous exercise, malnutrition, or lead poisoning, gout, renal disorders, increased breakdown of body cells
in some cancers (including leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) or cancer treatments, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell
anemia, or heart failure, pre-eclampsia, liver disease (cirrhosis), obesity, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, low blood levels of
parathyroid hormone (PTH), certain drugs, foods that are very high in purines - such as organ meats, red meats, some seafood
and beer. Decreased levels are seen in liver disease, Wilson's disease, Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH),
certain drugs.

3rd trimester —«*|0..3-3.0 1.00-2.60 6.95-15.7

® TSH levels are subject to circadian variation, reaching peak levels between 2 - 4.a.m. and at a minimum between 6-10 pm

® The variation is of the order of 50%, hence time of the day has influence on the measured serum TSH concentrations.

® TSH is secreted in a dual fashion: Intermittent pulses constitute 60-70% of total amount, background continuous secretion
is 30-40%.These pulses occur regularly every 1-3 hrs.

© Total T3 & T4 concentrations are altered by physiological or pathological changes in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)
capacity .

@ The determination of free T3 & free T4 has the advantage of being independent of changes in the concentrations and
binding properties of the binding proteins.

® Changes in thyroid status are typically associated with concordant changes in T3, T4 and TSH levels.

@ Unexpectedly abnormal or discordant thyroid test values may be seen with some rare, but clinically significant conditions
such as central hypothyroidism, TSH-secreting pituitary tumors, thyroid hormone resistance, or the presence of
heterophilic antibodies (HAMA) or thyroid hormone autoantibodies.

®@ For diagnostic purposes, results should be used in conjunction with other data.

B-hCG is normally synthesized and secreted by cells of the placenta or its precursor so the levels of the hormone in
normal, non pregnant individuals are low to undetectable.

@ B-hCG levels are used for diagnosis of pregnancy, investigation of suspected ectopic pregnancy and monitoring of IUI and
IVF patients.

@ The concentration of B-hCG in maternal serum rises rapidly during early pregnancy. B-hCG levels between 5 mIU/mL and
25 mIU/mL may be indicative of early pregnancy.

e

In pregnancy, the levels of hCG increase exponentially for about 8 to 10 weeks after the last menstrual cycle and values
generally peak during the first trimester.

@ The HCG levels double in about 1.5 days during the second to fifth week of gestation and doubling time increases
gradually to 2-3 days after 5 weeks of Gestation.

Later in pregnancy, about 12 weeks after conception, the concentration of hCG begins to fall as the placenta begins to
produce steroid hormones and decline slowly throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.

HCG concentrations increase slowly or decrease in Ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.

Causes of elevated HCG values are:

1. Normal Pregnancy

2. Recent termination of pregnancy

3. Gestational Trophoblastic disease.

4. Choriocarcinoma and Some Germ cell tumors

Result 0.32 S/CO <1.0 : Non Reactive CMIA
>=1.0 Reactive

Interpretation Non Reactive Non Reactive

Result in $/CO

The HBsAg Screening assay is used for the Qualitative detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in blood.
This assay is intended for screening, to prevent HBV transmission in blood recipients and to reduce risk of perinatal
transmission of HBV. It can also be used as an aid in diagnosis of HBV infection.

Non-Reactive test result indicates absence of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen.

Repeatedly Reactive specimens should be confirmed by a Neutralization test or Nucleic acid amplification (NAT e.g. HBV
DNA PCR) confirmatory test, before final diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

False Positive HBsAg can occur within 30 days of receiving hepatitis B vaccine, biotin supplements, mouse monoclonal
antibodies, and in presence of heterophilic antibodies.

False Negative results may be seen in presence of various HBV mutants, or if the sample is collected in early phase of
infection; this requires further additional testing.

Results should be interpreted in conjunction with patient history, HBV DNA PCR and other hepatitis markers for diagnosis
of acute and chronic infection.

Comment:

Result in S/CO

=

®@ This is a screening test to detect anti-HCV antibody using CMIA.

@ The CDC recommends the use of method specific optimal signal -to-cut- off ratio (S/CO) in interpretation & reporting

positive results. S/CO Ratio 1.0-5.0: Requires further supplemental tests for confirmation S/CO Ratio = 5.0: High
probability (95% or more) of being true positive.

Interpretation

@ A Reactive HCV antibody test may indicate current or resolved infection or a biological false positive. To differentiate past,
resolved HCV infection from biological false positives, another HCV antibody assay can be considered.

A reactive test cannot differentiate between the stages of Hepatitis C viral infection (Acute/ Chronic / Resolved infection)
nor is used to monitor the efficacy of treatment.

A Non-Reactive test result indicates Hepatitis C virus infection is unlikely, but cannot be completely ruled out. For

individuals potentially exposed to HCV in the last 6 months, it is advised to test for HCV RNA or conduct follow-up HCV
antibody testing.

Note:

All Reactive results require supplemental testing for confirmation with more specific assays like HCV RNA PCR or

Immunoblot. HCV RNA PCR is recommended in all Reactive results to differentiate between past and present infection. A

Reactive anti-HCV antibody result followed by a positive supplemental test (HCV RNA PCR) suggests active Hepatitis C
infection.

False Positive results are seen in autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypergammaglobulinemia, passive antibody
transfers, liver disease, sexually transmitted disease (STD) and anti-superoxide dismutase.
False Negative results are seen in early acute infection, immunosuppression & immuno-incompetent states.

Results should be interpreted in conjunction with patient history and other hepatitis markers like HCV-RNA for diagnosis of
acute or chronic infection.

Uses:

® Routine screening of low and high risk populations including blood donors.
@ Prenatal Screening of pregnant women.

Result 0.05 S/CO <1.0 CMIA
Interpretation Non Reactive Non Reactive

Result in $/CO

® HIV Ag-Ab Combo is a 4 th generation qualitative assay for simultaneous detection of HIV p24 antigen and antibodies
associated with HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 virus in human serum.

® This test is used as an aid in diagnosis of HIV-1/HIV-2 infection and also as a screening test for detection of HIV positivity
in donated blood or plasma.

® A Non-Reactive result indicates that antibodies to HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 are not detected in the sample. This may suggest

that the patient has not been exposed to HIV-1 or HIV-2, or that the sample was taken during the "window period", i.e.
before detectable levels of antibodies have developed. Therefore, a non-reactive result does not rule out the possibility of
HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection.

@ A Reactive result suggests the possibility of HIV 1 or HIV 2 infection. However, it does not differentiate between type of

antibody and antigen detected. All reactive results are tested by three different principles /techniques before being
reported as HIV positive. A positive result indicates presence of either p24 antigen or antibody against HIV-1/2 or both.
® In case of “Indeterminate” result, repeat testing is advised after 2-4 weeks is advisable.

® Confirmatory tests with high specificity, like Western Blots and line immunoassays, or HIV RNA PCR are used in cases of
positive/indeterminate/discordant results.

® Results should be interpreted in conjunction with patient history

® Rarely false negativity/positivity may occur. False positives may be seen in autoimmune disease, alcoholic hepatitis,

primary biliary cirrhosis, leprosy, multiple pregnancies, and due to presence of rheumatoid factor and heterophile
antibodies. False negatives may be seen during the Window period and during the end stage of the disease.

® Disclaimer: This is a Screening Test.
® Test values may vary depending on the assay method used.

® Sensitivity of the test is 100%. Specificity of the test is 99.85% with a confidence interval at 95% of (99.61-99.96%).

Comment:

Note : Titres of 1:8 and above are significant.

Comments:

@ The Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) is a Screening test for Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum. It is macroscopic,
nontreponemal flocculation card test.

@ Autoantibodies are produced in 2-3 weeks of treponemal infection due to tissue damage.Rising titers are of immense
value in confirming the diagnosis.

@ RPR measures IgM and IgG antibodies to lipodial materials released from damaged host cells as well as lipoprotein like

material and possibly cardiolipin released from treponems.

Biological false positive reaction occurs as cardiolipin antigen is seen in persons with autoimmune disease (SLE, rheumatic

disorder), leprosy, and malaria & in intravenous drug addiction.Also, ilow titers can be found in conditions like Viral

fevers,Mycoplasma infection,Chlamydia infection,Immunizations,Pregnancy.

® It is advisable to confirm the diagnosis by tests -TPHA &FTA-ABS

Comment:

eNote: Pre-test condition to be observed while submitting the sample-first void, mid stream urine, collected in a clean, dry, sterile
container is recommended for routine urine analysis, avoid contamination with any discharge from vaginal, urethra, perineum,
Avoid prolonged transit time & undue exposure to sunlight.

During interpretation, points to be considered are Negative nitrite test does not exclude the urinary tract infections. Trace
proteinuria can be seen with many physiological conditions like prolonged recumbency, exercise, high protein diet. False positive
reactions for bile pigments, proteins, glucose and nitrites can be caused by peroxidase like activity by disinfectants, therapeutic
dyes, ascorbic acid and certain drugs.® Urine microscopy is done in centrifuged urine specimens
